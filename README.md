Blade is a half-vampire, half-mortal man becomes a protector of the mortal race, while slaying evil vampires.

Also Blade is the simple, yet powerful templating engine that is included with Laravel. Unlike some PHP templating engines, Blade does not restrict you from using plain PHP code in your templates.

Blade_Components is a repository where i'll be continuously storing various blade componets I make while I am coding. Don't know how this repo will end up. ðŸ˜€
